-Use vapoursynth instead of FFMpeg directly in Bash

IN EDITOR
-Video Viewer, once EIRTeam fixes addon
-Rename "doc_lib" with "doc_method"

-Similarity Algorithm
-(Fixed?) Current Page is reseting when changing to viewer and adding tags to docs.
-Do Browsers highlight the doc selected by other browsers of the viewer through «_on_selected_doc()»?
-Applying filter doesn't reset page number to 1

-Improved "About" panel
-Sorting on Browsers
-Cleanup Database:
	-remove database entries which doc path doesn't point to a file. (Probably removed files/docs)
	-delete thumbnails for which there is not doc path in DB
	-delete tag info and alias not mentioned in DB.docs
	-reconstruct "tag_hash" entries
	-reconstruct "synon" entries
	-automatically add "repeated" tag to files with the same filename or same hash.

-Scanning files gets the content hashes which should be checked to account for files moving folders, in which case it only updates the file path in the database.

-Tag Info doesn't change family color for all tags on the list
-Add Folder directory is expanded absolute in editor

ON EXPORT

-Tag Renaming Still not fixed?


THE FUTURE:
-Refactor database tab once we figure out Tree nodes better
-Find the current page that shows the same results when switching browser tabs
